# euphemera

A bot that wanders through **Ephemera** and posts the results to a Tumblr as a
running case study of the system. Each post is a *specimen* — a collage plus a
lab-notebook caption (`vibe 0.80 · auto · seed 7f3a2c01 · 14 fragments · openverse ×9`).

```
experiment  ->  /generate  ->  Playwright screenshot  ->  Tumblr post
(quirk to       (existing      (renders the real         (caption = readout,
 demonstrate)    pipeline)      frontend, injected)        tags = the axes)
```

## How it renders

The backend already bakes the entire visual into each fragment's `layout`
(position, rotation, CSS filter, blend mode). `render.py` injects the fetched
collage JSON into the frontend page and screenshots `#canvas`, so the output is
**pixel-identical to the live app** — the same `buildFragment()` does the drawing,
no second renderer to keep in sync.

## Experiments

| experiment       | what it demonstrates                                   | post type  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `density-ladder` | `fog` → `fog harbor` → `fog harbor 1932`, vibe climbing | photoset   |
| `seed-series`    | one prompt, N layout seeds — deterministic vs. chance   | photoset   |
| `neutral-zone`   | near-synonyms whose vibe is decided by an md5, not meaning | photoset |
| `domain-drift`   | one ambiguous word fanning across senses               | single     |
| `specimen`       | a plain pull — ordinary behavior                       | single     |

Tags stay a small closed vocabulary: `#ephemera` + the series tag (+ a
`#sparse`/`#dense`/`#neutral-zone` band on single posts). All the numbers live in
the caption, never in tags.

## Setup

### 1. Tumblr credentials
1. **Register an app** at <https://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps> → Consumer Key + Secret.
2. **Get user tokens** at <https://api.tumblr.com/console> — paste the consumer
   key/secret, authorize against your logged-in account, and it shows all four
   credentials including the OAuth Token + Token Secret.
3. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the four creds + `TUMBLR_BLOG`.

### 2. Python deps
From the backend dir:
```bash
pip install -r app/publisher/requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Point at a pipeline
`EPHEMERA_API_URL` must reach the backend where jobs are created.
`EPHEMERA_FRONTEND_URL` must serve a `collage.js` that has the headless render
hook (this repo's does). For local dev, `docker compose up` gives you the API on
:8000 and the frontend on :3000.

## Run

```bash
# from backend/
python -m app.publisher.publish verify         # check creds
python -m app.publisher.publish render --experiment density-ladder --out /tmp/eu
python -m app.publisher.publish run    --experiment random --state draft
```

- `verify` — confirms auth, prints the target blog.
- `render` — full pipeline + screenshots + prints captions, **posts nothing**. Use this first.
- `run` — also posts. Defaults to `--state draft` so nothing goes public until you look.

### Going live / scheduling
Set `EUPHEMERA_POST_STATE=queue` and configure the blog's queue (Settings → Queue)
to drip 1–3 posts/day at random times — that's your scheduler for free. Then a cron
that runs `... publish run --experiment random --count 3` every morning keeps the
queue fed.

## Notes
- `render` and `run` need the backend + frontend reachable; `verify` only needs Tumblr.
- `seed-series` and the `seed` shown in captions rely on the backend `layout_seed`
  plumbing (GenerateRequest.layout_seed). Older collages fall back to the topic hash.
